```assembly
mov eax, [ebx+4]
add eax, 1
mov [ebx+4], eax
```
This code snippet demonstrates a potential race condition in assembly. If another thread or process modifies the value at memory location `[ebx+4]` between the `mov` and `add` instructions, the result will be incorrect. The `add` instruction will operate on a stale value, leading to unexpected behavior.  This is particularly problematic in multi-threaded environments where shared memory is involved.
