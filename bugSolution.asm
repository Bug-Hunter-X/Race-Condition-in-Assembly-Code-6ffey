```assembly
; Solution using atomic operations (if available)
lock add eax, [ebx+4] ; Atomically increments the value at [ebx+4]

; Alternatively, using mutexes or semaphores (architecture specific)
; ... acquire mutex/semaphore ...
mov eax, [ebx+4]
add eax, 1
mov [ebx+4], eax
; ... release mutex/semaphore ...
```
The solution demonstrates using atomic instructions if your architecture provides them.  Atomic instructions perform the increment operation indivisibly, guaranteeing correct results even in concurrent environments. If atomic instructions aren't available,  proper synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes or semaphores are necessary to protect the shared memory location and prevent race conditions.
